# Rikarin Metaverse

Rikarin Metaverse is a 3D web browser for browsing lands instead of websites. The main idea is based on concept of mixing web browser with decentralized VR like SecondLife. 

Lands (Pages) can be written in similar language as HTML (DTML)  
and stylized in similar language as CSS (DSS).

For writing functional code C# can be used (instead of JS like in traditional websites).


HUD - 2D GUI can be also developed within DTML and DSS.


For writing dynamic backend C# can be used with our basic server template which includes (will include) avatar sync, chat, voice chat and many more.
